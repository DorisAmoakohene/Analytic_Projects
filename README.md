# Hey
I’m a graduate student with a deep passion for transforming raw data into impactful business insights. With a Masters in Informatics and Bsc. in Statistics and ongoing studies in Msc. in Business Analytics, I will be building projects analyzing customer behavior, sales performance, and operational metrics using Python, SQL, and BI tools.

I'm currently seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my skills in real-world business settings—especially roles involving data analysis, decision support, and performance improvement.

Let’s connect if you’re looking for someone who brings both technical and strategic thinking to the table.
